    <h2>about</h2>
    <p>This blog will follow my progress in learning web development. I am starting this process with some programming knowledge, but very little in web development specifically.</p>
    <p>I will discuss the educational resources I use, what I think about those resources and their usefulness, and also share projects that I work on along the way. Once I start to reach some level of proficiency, I intend to use this blog to discuss more advanced topics related to web development.</p>
    <p>It is my hope that one day in the future, people can use this site to see what the process of learning web development is like and gain useful insight into how they should go about the process themselves (should that be their interest).</p>
