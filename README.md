# coherent code beta

This is a repository for current and previous versions of the website I am building. It's primary purpose will be to house my blog, which currently lives on <a href="http://www.coherentcode.wordpress.com" title="coherent code blog on wordpress" target="_blank">WordPress</a>.

Version 1.0 -- Raw HTML with no scripting or styling. Much of the functionality that I'd like to add to the site is still missing.
Version 1.1.0 -- Added basic CSS styling, updated HTML per hooks needed in CSS. Created a new branch to store the raw HTML (V1.0).
